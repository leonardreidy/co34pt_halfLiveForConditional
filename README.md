# co34pt - Half-Live for Conditional Records

## About

This is a repo containing all of the code and samples used to create the [Conditional Records](http://www.conditional.club/) release ['Half-Live for Conditional Records'](http://shop.conditional.club/album/half-live-for-conditional-records). It was initially an attempt to create some small, condensed tracks based on material I use during live sets, exemplifying particular 'sounds' I was used to drawing upon. 

I created some code drafts that I improvised with and recorded a few times to get a feel for them, and then tried to 'perform' them in five minutes or less each to get something that sounded more polished.

This didn't work. I didn't like the five minute tracks and I was forcing those techniques into a format they weren't designed for. 

I instead decided to pick three of my favourite recordings of those drafts and use them for the release.They're not the cleanest recordings technically or sonically, but I think they work way better than any attempted distillation I tried.

The code in this repo can be run in a similar way to my other projects [howto_co34pt_liveCode](https://github.com/theseanco/howto_co34pt_liveCode) and [HSPTLFLDHS](https://github.com/theseanco/hsptlfldhs) repos: run the code `Setup.scd` file in the `Setup` folder, and then the code in the `trackDrafts` folder can be run. There are also some `loadRelative` lines at the top of each track which will do the same thing.

The `.scd` files supplied are designed to be run in order, with each block or line being a change in the music. It might not sound exactly like the tracks on the record as there's a lot of randomness involved in creating the music, and the files themselves are a reconstruction of draft performances.

- `sinesTrack.scd` is track 1 
- `AcidTrack.scd` is track 2
- `raveTrack.scd` is track 3

I try to use permissively-licensed samples and release my code wherever possible in a way that is useful.
